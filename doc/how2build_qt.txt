                           <Whatisthis.sowhat_at_gmail.com>

1.First of all
Common Source Code Project the (CSP) in terms of porting to Qt, the build
There is a voice that does not know well when using the method - especially MinGW to or
So it was, we wrote a little.

2. What you need
• The Windows of the person, MinGW is required ... is, open-source version of Qt
The installer [1] (in the case of Qt5.5.1 GCC4.9.2) MinGW is
It comes with, but, half-hearted.
· GCC (may not be good Qt and compatibility that it LLVM CLANG)
· Qt5.1 or more, of course also the development files such as header.
· OpenGL 2.1 or more moves environment. With the software renderer in Windows for Qt
You've had.
· CMake [2] 2.8 or more
· LibSDL2 [3]
If - if possible, it can be slightly faster and use the CCACHE [4]
If · git [5] is, child download the source code from the repository [6]
You bet you can.
· Emufm7 part of the code of the source code in the gawk from a text file
Users had dropped to. However, the file after generation to the source tree
It contains.

[1] Windows for in http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ of (32 / 64bit)
Please try using the installer

[3] http://libsdl.org/

    https://www.pikacode.com/Artanejp/common_source_project-fm7/
    
These things, GNU / Linux if such and MinGW, package management software
In will be put in the majority.

3. How to Build
  3-1. Basic method
The source tree allowed to expand to $ {SRCDIR},
      $ Cd $ {SRCDIR} / source / build-cmake / {VM name} /
      $ Mkdir -p build
      $ Cd build
      $ Cmake .. ※ [7]
      $ Make
  It went well,
      $ Sudo make install

In fact, [7], it is convenient setting is better to use the ccmake of CursesGUI version of CMake.

   In the case of 3-2.MinGW
     It is basically the same, and use the windeployqt.exe of Qt, the necessary Qt La
     For us to copy the library.
     However, DLL of libstdc associated with libSDL2 and OpenGL relationship is to manually copy
     That you will need.
     Since there is no CMake is the official MinGW, please download from [8].
     
     Install the a.MinGW.
     mingw32-gcc and mingw32-g ++ and mingw32-binutils,
     mingw-developer-toolkit and mingw32-pthreds-w32
     Please install the sure.
     
     To register the shortcut of b.MSYS Bash, for example, on your desktop and menu
     Let's place. If the default installation location,
     Is C: \ MinGW \ msys \ 1.0 \ msys.bat.
     
     Install the c.Qt.
     Start the installer you downloaded from [1], the mingw toolchain
     Install in, including form.
     
     Install the d.CMake.
     Whether to include the CMake the path? Come ask the installer and
     So please check.
     
     If e. Necessary, install the Git.
     
     f.C:. \ MinGW \ msys \ 1.0 \ home \ {username} \ to edit the profile.
     At this time, since performed in Notepad problem comes out, use the vim.
     From the MSYS BASH
       $ Vim ~ / .profile
       Please to add the following line.
           export PATH = / c / MinGw / bin: $ PATH: /c/Qt/Qt5.5.1/5.5/mingw492_32/bin
       When you are finished, in the [ESC] → ZZ command, it writes.
       
     g.SDL2 Install. (Reference: [9])
     Download SDL2 have been "Windows Development MinGW" tarball of
       The expand and install.
       $ Tar xf SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz
       $ Cd SDL2-2.0.4
       $ Mingw32-make install-package arch = i686-w64-mingw32 prefix = / c / mingw
       
     h. When you come up to this point, to start the MSYS BASH again.
     And, of release page in the source and github that have been taken in the git clone
       Expand the source code. Here, describing the full path to the $ {SRCDIR}
       To do.
       
     i. Build.
       $ Cd $ {SRCDIR}
       $ Cd source / build-cmake / $ {VM name}
       $ Mkdir build-win32
       $ Cd build-win32
       $ Cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
        ※[Ten]
       $ Mingw32-make

     ※ Notes: Windwos on (the native) in MinGW, rather than make, mingw32-make
     Use and the like. I have a Windows side is make, yet this is the unix format
     Since it is a villainy specification that not me seriously interpret the Makefile ...
     
     j. cormorant or Ku be or prayer a call that came in buildings de
     
     k. When you build, the directory to the emu $ {VM name} .exe for moving
     Copy.
     
     l. on which has moved to copy the previous directory I,
       $ Windeployqt.exe --release emu $ {VM name} .exe
       If you, copy the necessary Qt libraries in release mode Shiteku
       Are you, but the copy manually, such as libSDL2 and libpthread and libgcc_s
       If that does not, can not be started from the Windows Explorer (;'Д `)
       In addition, it specifies the Debug and Relwithdebinfo to build the type of CMake
       Time,
       $ Windeployqt.exe --debug emu $ {VM name} .exe
       Let's say.
       Then, the following file C: \ Qt \ Qt5.5.1 \ mingw492_32 \ bin (such as)
       Or, or from C: \ MinGW \ bin, and copy it to the directory where you placed the exe.
       icudt54.dll
       icuin54.dll
       icuuc54.dll
       libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
       libstdc ++ - 6.dll
       libwinpthread-1.dll
       On top of that, SDL2.dll (C: should located in the \ MinGW \ bin) is also, in this directory
       Copy.

[10] In fact, once after you move the CMake, a fine setting to start the cmake-gui
Better to is better.

   3-3. Cross build (do the build for Windows in such as GNU / Linux)
   Here, in the GNU / Linux host, how to cross build the CSP for Windows
   You have a brief description.
   Become an aid for the ARM build and other OS Builds for Android, etc. for
   Award.

a. installation of cross compiler
In most cases, because there is a cross-GCC Toolchain for MinGW, it
Install.

Installation of b.Wine
Because such as moc there is a need to use for Windows, install the Wine want
It is.
On top of that, so that you can start a file of exe extension via Wine
There to support scripts such as binfmt-support, set in the upda-ebinfmts
To do. [11]
$ Sudo update-binfmts --install Win32Exec / usr / bin / wine --magic "MZ"
I think that it was good at (I'm sorry in faint memory)

[11] http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kakurasan/20110909/p1 such as the reference.

c.Qt for Windows installation of
From the URL of the [1], you drop the installer for Windows.
And,
$ Sudo wine ./qt-opensource-foo.exe
will do.
Then because Qt installer screen comes out,
Z: \ usr \ local \ i586-mingw-msvc
Please specify to the installation.
At this time,
$ Sudo chmod ugo + x /usr/local/i586-mingw-msvc/5.5/mingw492_32/bin/*.exe
As such, let's be able to start the tool for Windows Qt directly attached.

d.libSDL2 installation of
libSDL2 also, and you should install the ones for Windows.
From [3], download for Windows SDL2 (for Development),
/ Usr / local / i586-mingw-msvc / Let's expand to around.

e. Cross build
Although we use the ToolChain function of CMake, so many things setting is confusing,
Already Yes available are those described.
$ {SRCDIR} /source/build-cmake/cmake/toolchain_mingw_cross_linux.cmake
Messing with description of this file,
$ Cd $ {SRCDIR} / source / build-cmake / {VM name} /
 $ Mkdir -p build
  $ Cd build
   $ Cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE = .. / .. / cmake / toolchain_mingw_cross_linux.cmake
    $ Make
    In it you should be okay.
    
3-3. Trying to music
In the description up to this point, we have to build the manual in a virtual machine basis.
However, although the once could under preparation, is every time awkward every time.
Therefore, a batch file (Bash script) are available.
· $ {SRCDIR} /source/build-cmake/config_build.sh: normal build
· $ {SRCDIR} /source/build-cmake/config_build_cross_win32.sh
: To build a file for MinGW32 (Windows) on GNU / Linux
Script
· $ {SRCDIR} /source/build-cmake/config_build_mingw.sh
: Script to build a file for MinGW with MinGW on Windows

config_build.sh will continue to write the settings to a file called buildvars.dat.
config_build_mingw.sh is, the settings to a file called buildvars_mingw.dat
I will continue to write.

How to use it,
$ ./Doru {Script name} $ {VM name 1} $ {VM name 2} ... $ {VM name n}
is.
Generate the Makefiles from CMake → make → install → make clean
Done in full automatic.

For make results, $ in {VM name} /build/make.log (MinGW for cross build
$ Have been recorded in the {VM name} /build-win32/build.log).

For Windows-friendly build, $ {SRCDIR} / source / build-cmake / bin-win32 /
Copy the resulting binary in, and clean the build working directory.

For batch build, and use the Midnight Commander (mc), it is very easy.
For more information, the https://www.midnight-commander.org/.
Windows of unofficial build, https: to //sourceforge.net/projects/mcwin32/
Equipped therefore, let's install using the installer.
