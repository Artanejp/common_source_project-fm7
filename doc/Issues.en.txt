* If you specify a H.264 the video codec of the video there is no end one second about the video
→ of libx264 codec side of ffmpeg (the end of the process?) Problem.
Future reports to ffmpeg development side.

* Sound If you specify a Vorbis to audio codec of the video does not turn
→ examine workaround

* Specify the aac to the audio codec of the video, and sound a long vowel in the PSG single note griping
And was to, such as high-pitched noise to enter (example: emufm7 run the PLAY "V15AAAAA" in)
→ seems to ffmpeg of built-in AAC codec problem. The MP3 does not occur.

* Specify the H.264 the video codec of the video, the entire machine while recording a high fps
When the load is high, continue to consume more and more memory
→ H.264 CPU resources to avoid the encoding is processing delay is not enough.
  → was the image to a minimum memory consumption when enqueue from OSD to MOVIE_SAVER (2016-08-16)

* The PC-8801/9801 series (+ perhaps PC-8001SR), the voice of the sample rate
When you save the video as 48000Hz, sound becomes strange.
→ has issued a voice at a sample rate 55600Hz but, ffmpeg side 96000Hz
I have a record as. The main improvement in the future. → Although the pitch was healed, lucky Bata (2016-08-16)

  → fix in the next release (2016-08-16)
  
* PX7: When moving load take Kaku
  Since → video in the code of a timing issue, and a little thought.
  → I could probably. Yet the moving of measures of variable frame rate (2016-08-19)

* PX7: video scaling is funny
  → fix later (;'Д `)

* WIN32: On debugger window, click close button on DESKTOP, then quit debugger with "q" command, emulator hangs.
