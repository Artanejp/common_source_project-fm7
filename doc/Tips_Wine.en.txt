1.Background
 Using OpenGL ES (launch with -g gles) at native windows 
 seems to work correctly via Google's Angle project.
 But running via Wine ( http://winehq.org/ ) (at maybe GNU/Linux),
 with OpenGL 2/3/4 works correctly, but with Angle project
 don't work.

2.How to
  a. Download DirectX development files from Microsoft.
  b. Extract below CABs under Redist/ :
     Aug2009_D3DCompiler_42_x86.cab
     Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x86.cab
     â€» If you build for Win64 and running via Wine64, below files
       are required:
     Aug2009_D3DCompiler_42_x64.cab
     Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x64.cab
  
  c. Copy D3DCompiler_[42|43].dll to
     $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32 (or wow64?).
     
  d. Run winecfg and select "Libraries".
  e. Set override DLL to d3dcompiler_42.dll and d3dcompiler_43.dll
     to "Native, builtin".
     
  f. If you don't wrong, running correctly with Angle project and Wine :-)
  
Good luck!
