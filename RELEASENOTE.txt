1.About

This package is Qt5 porting of Common Source Code Project (CSP)
and Built with Visual Studio 2015 + DirectX9 + Direct Input 8 for Win32.

 Note: Linux AMD64 and Windows 32bit Binaries are below:

2.Background
Common Source Code Project (CSP) is good emulator writing.
It also distributed with GPLv2, this is good for me.
But codes are specified to M$ Visual C.
I'm using GNU/Linux, and I starting to apply FM-7(or later).
So, I start to port to GNU/Linux and using Qt4/Qt5.


What you need at least:
a. Qt5 (neither Qt3 and Qt4) toolkit.
b. Some OpenGL implementation, maybe at leaset OpenGL v2.x .
c. gcc / g++ (4.7 or later? ) or llvm clang / clang++ (3.5 or later?) toolchain.
d. SDL2 (not SDL1.x).
e. CMake 2.8 or later.

3.How to build:
After extracting (or git pulled) sourcecodes:
$ cd {srctop}/source/build-cmake/{Machine name}/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To configure:
$ cmake ..
or
$ ccmake ..

To build:
$ make

To install:
$ sudo make install

4.Qt specified notice:
・Place R@Ms under $HOME/emu{Machine Name}/ , this directory has made
after first using.
・Config file, {foo}.ini is writteon on $HOME/.config/emu{Machine Name}/ .

5.Status
a. I tested to build only under Debian GNU/Linux "sid".
But, perhaps, will succed to build another GNU/Linux OSs or
BSD OS variants.
On windows, using MinGW or Cygwin is not tested yet,
still use M$ Visual Studio 2013 (Community edition).

b. Now, I using Qt5 as toolkit, because authors of Qt announced
"Qt4 is obsolete, will be updated no longer".

c. These machines are already ported to Qt (On Sep 26, 2015):
     ・Ascii MSX1/MSX2 (not PX-7).
     ・Casio FP-1100 .
     ・Casio FP-200 .
     ・Epson HC-20/40/80.
     ・Fujitsu FM-7/77/AV/40/40EX .(→ READ readme_fm7.jp.txt or readme_fm7.txt)
     ・Fujitsu FM16pi .
     ・Fujitsu FM-R50(i286/i386/i486)/R60/R70/R80/R250/R280 (Not tested enough).
     ・Gijyutu hyouronsya babbage2nd.
     ・Hitachi Basic Master Jr.
     ・National (Matsushita) Jr100 .
     ・NEC PC-6001/mk2/mk2SR .
     ・NEC PC-6601/SR .
     ・NEC PC8001mk2SR (Not tested enough).
     ・NEC PC8801MA .
     ・NEC PC-9801/E/U/VF/VM .
     ・NEC PC98DO .
     ・NEC PC98LT/HA .
     ・NEC HE PC-ENGINE.
     ・NEC TK-80BS .
     ・NEC HE PC Engine.
     ・Tomy PYUTA.
     ・Sega Game Gear/Master System (Mark3).
     ・Sharp X1/turbo/turboZ/Twin.
     ・Sharp MZ-700/800/1500 .
     ・Sharp MZ-80A/K/1200 .
     ・Sharp MZ-80B/2200/2500 .
     ・Shinko Sangyou YS-6464a .
     ・Toshiba J-3100SL .
     ・Z80 TV Game (Hand made)

d. Now using GCC-5.2 with Link Time Optimize to build for distrubuted binaries.
