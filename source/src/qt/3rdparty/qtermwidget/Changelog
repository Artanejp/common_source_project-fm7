## Old changelog

31.07.2008
Interface class from c-style conversions rewritten with pimpl support.


16.07.2008
Added optional scrollbar


06.06.2008
Some artefacts were removed, some added...
Also added support for color schemes, and 3 color schemes provided (classical - white on black, green on black, black on light yellow). Is it enough or not?


26.05.2008
Added file release as an archive with source code. But preferrable way is still getting code from CVS, cause file release can be outdated.


11.05.2008
Initial CVS import - first version comes with number 0.0.1
