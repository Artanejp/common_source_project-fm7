1.About

This package is Qt5 porting of Common Source Code Project (CSP)
and built with Qt5, for Windows, built with MinGW(32bit).

Source Code:

   https://github.com/Artanejp/common_source_project-fm7/releases/tag/SNAPSHOT_20180326
   
Additional INFO:

   Binaries will be available, distibute from osdn.net.
   
   See, https://osdn.net/projects/csp-qt/  and
        https://osdn.net/projects/csp-qt/releases/ .
	
   Released at:


2.Background

Common Source Code Project (CSP) is good emulator writing.
It also distributed with GPLv2, this is good for me.

But codes are specified to M$ Visual C.
I'm using GNU/Linux, and I starting to apply FM-7(or later).

So, I start to port to GNU/Linux and using Qt4/Qt5.

What you need at least:

a. Qt5 (neither Qt3 and Qt4) toolkit: Qt5.3 or later.

b. Some OpenGL implementation, maybe at leaset OpenGL v2.x .

c. gcc / g++ (5.0 or later? ) or llvm clang / clang++ (3.5 or later?) toolchain.

d. SDL2 (not SDL1.x).

e. CMake 2.8 or later.

* TIPS: If emufoo.exe don't show screen drawing, set environment variable QT_OPENGL to software (i.e. Using Windows as VirtualBox's gueat OS).


3.How to build:

After extracting (or git pulled) sourcecodes:

$ cd {srctop}/source/build-cmake/{Machine name}/

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

To configure:

$ cmake ..

or

$ ccmake ..

To build:

$ make

To install:

$ sudo make install

4.Qt specified notice:
   
   ・Config file (scancode.cfg and foo.ini) has placed (moved) to
     "~/.config/CommonSourceCodeProject/emufoo/"
     (for Windows, ".\CommonSourceCodeProject\emudfoo\" ).
   
   ・BIOS, WAVS, BINS and SAVED STATES have placed (moved) to
     "~/CommonSourceCodeProject/emufoo/"
     (for Windows, ".\CommonSourceCodeProject\emudfoo\" ).
   
   ・All of recorded products (PNG Screenshots, MOVIES, SOUNDS) 
     have *temporally* written to "~/.config/CommonSourceCodeProject/emufoo/"
     (for Windows, ".\CommonSourceCodeProject\emudfoo\" ).
   
   ・Added ToolTips and Japanese translations.(2017-01-24)
   
   ・Place R@Ms under $HOME/CommonSourceCodeProject/emu{Machine Name}/ , this directory has made
     after first using.
   
   ・Config file, {foo}.ini is written on $HOME/.config/CommonSourceCodeProject/emu{Machine Name}/ .
   
   ・Saved state file, {foo}.sta is written on $HOME/CommonSourceCodeProject/emu{Machine Name}/ .
   
   ・Key code conversion file is written on $HOME/.config/CommonSourceCodeProject/emu{Machine Name}/scancode.cfg .
   
     This file contains comma separated fields, written at hex-decimal (not decimal), 
       first is M$ Virtual Key Code,
       second is Qt's scan code.
       
   ・Common UI components (at src/qt/gui ) are moved to shared lib. libCSPgui.so .
   
   ・Installer (bash) script is available now; src/tool/installer_unix.sh .
   
   ・When you place specified WAV files(differ per VM) same directory as ROMs, you can sound sounds: i.e. FDD seek, CMT relay and buttons.
  
5.Status

a. I tested to build only under Debian GNU/Linux "sid",Ubuntu Linux 16.04LTS "Xenial" for AMD64 (x86_64)
and MinGW with GCC6 (Windows 32bit).

   But, perhaps, will succed to build another GNU/Linux OSs or BSD OS variants.
   
   * On windows, using MinGW is already okay, but not tested drawing.
   
   * Cross building with GNU/Linux's MinGW32 and Qt5.5.1 (for MinGW) is available. 
     Modify and use build-cmake/config_build_cross_win32.sh and related *.cmake files.
     
   * And, you can also build with M$ Visual Studio 2013 or 2015.

b. Now, I using Qt5 as toolkit, because authors of Qt announced "Qt4 is obsolete, will be updated no longer".

c. All of virtual machines are already ported to Qt (On Oct 29, 2015).

d. Now using GCC-6.1 with Link Time Optimize to build for distrubuted binaries.

e. Implemented socket, networking for MZ-2500, but, not tested yet (；´Д｀)
