1.About

This package is Qt5 porting of Common Source Code Project (CSP)
and Built with Visual Studio 2015 + DirectX9 + Direct Input 8 for Win32.

Additional INFO:
GNU/Linux with AMD64 binaries and Win32 with MINGW binaries are avaiable, packed with 7zip'ed format:

2.Background
Common Source Code Project (CSP) is good emulator writing.
It also distributed with GPLv2, this is good for me.
But codes are specified to M$ Visual C.
I'm using GNU/Linux, and I starting to apply FM-7(or later).
So, I start to port to GNU/Linux and using Qt4/Qt5.

What you need at least:
a. Qt5 (neither Qt3 and Qt4) toolkit.
b. Some OpenGL implementation, maybe at leaset OpenGL v2.x .
c. gcc / g++ (4.7 or later? ) or llvm clang / clang++ (3.5 or later?) toolchain.
d. SDL2 (not SDL1.x).
e. CMake 2.8 or later.

   * TIPS: If emufoo.exe don't show screen drawing, set environment 
           variable QT_OPENGL to software (i.e. Using Windows as VirtualBox's gueat OS).


3.How to build:
After extracting (or git pulled) sourcecodes:
$ cd {srctop}/source/build-cmake/{Machine name}/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To configure:
$ cmake ..
or
$ ccmake ..

To build:
$ make

To install:
$ sudo make install

4.Qt specified notice:
・Place R@Ms under $HOME/emu{Machine Name}/ , this directory has made
after first using.
・Config file, {foo}.ini is writteon on $HOME/.config/emu{Machine Name}/ .

5.Status
a. I tested to build only under Debian GNU/Linux "sid".
   But, perhaps, will succed to build another GNU/Linux OSs or BSD OS variants.
   * On windows, using MinGW is already okay, but not tested drawing.
   * Cross building with GNU/Linux's MinGW32 and Qt5.5.1 (for MinGW) is available. 
     Modify and use build-cmake/config_build_cross_win32.sh and related *.cmake files.
   * And, you can also build with M$ Visual Studio 2013 or 2015.

b. Now, I using Qt5 as toolkit, because authors of Qt announced
   "Qt4 is obsolete, will be updated no longer".

c. All of virtual machines are already ported to Qt (On Oct 29, 2015):
d. Now using GCC-5.2 with Link Time Optimize to build for distrubuted binaries.
